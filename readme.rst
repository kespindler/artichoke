Hey, if any of you use Evernote and read a lot of Journal articles, you might find the Mac Service that I just created to be somewhat useful.

https://github.com/kespindler/artichoke

Install it, right-click a journal article PDF, click the Service, then hit Cmd+C to copy the doc. In a moment, Evernote will pop up with a new Note containing the metadata for the PDF. Title, Author,  Abstract, Bibtex citation. Now Cmd+V  to attach the document to Evernote.

If you find bugs, have feedback, etc, I'd love to hear it. Enjoy!
